# üè¢ CBRE Neo4j Agentic RAG API

## üß≠ Retrieval Routing Overview
This diagram shows how the agent routes incoming questions to different retrieval strategies:
![Retriever architecture diagram](assets/retriever-architecture.png)

This project is a FastAPI-powered agentic RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) backend, built around the `neo4j-graphrag` library. It dynamically chooses between structured (`text2cypher`) and unstructured (`vector`, `vector_cypher`) retrieval strategies using LangGraph routing and LLM-based decisioning.

**Purpose**: Real estate knowledge graph for CBRE, enabling intelligent querying of property data, market insights, and industry knowledge.

## üîß Setup

### 1. Install dependencies (Poetry)
Make sure you're using Python 3.11 and have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed.
```bash
poetry install
```

### 2. Configure environment
Create a `.env` file at the root with the following:
```env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://<your-uri>
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=<your-password>
NEO4J_DATABASE=neo4j
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o
TEMPERATURE=0.0
TEXT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-large
```

---

## üöÄ Run Locally (Dev Script)
To start both the FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend locally using Poetry:

```bash
chmod +x run_local.sh
./run_local.sh
```

- üîß Backend: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- üß† Frontend: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

## üê≥ Run with Docker Compose
To run the backend and frontend in containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- üåê Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- üéõÔ∏è Frontend: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## üè¢ CBRE-Specific Example Usage
Send a POST request to `/ask` with a real estate question:

```bash
POST /ask
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "Show me office properties in downtown areas with vacancy rates below 10%"
}
```

The system will:
1. Use LangGraph to route the query to the appropriate retriever
2. Run either a Cypher query or a vector similarity search (or both)
3. Return structured results from the CBRE knowledge graph as JSON

---

## üìù Managing Query Examples

The system uses external query examples stored in `query_examples.yml` to help the LLM generate better Cypher queries. These examples show the LLM how to convert natural language questions into proper Cypher queries.

### Adding New Examples

To add new query examples, edit the `query_examples.yml` file:

```yaml
query_examples:
  - input: "Show me all office properties in downtown areas"
    output: |
      MATCH (p:Property)
      WHERE p.property_type = 'Office' AND p.location CONTAINS 'downtown'
      RETURN p.name, p.address, p.property_type, p.location
      LIMIT 10
```

### Example Categories

The current examples cover:
- **Property Types**: Office, retail, industrial, residential
- **Financial Metrics**: Cap rates, rental rates, property values
- **Geographic Queries**: Location-based searches, downtown areas
- **Management**: CBRE-managed properties, tenant information
- **Market Data**: Vacancy rates, days on market, lease information
- **Amenities**: Parking, energy efficiency, maintenance
- **Time-based**: Recent activities, upcoming expirations

### Best Practices

1. **Use Real Schema**: Ensure examples match your actual Neo4j schema
2. **Variety**: Include different query patterns and complexity levels
3. **Domain-Specific**: Focus on real estate terminology and concepts
4. **Clear Patterns**: Show consistent naming conventions and relationships
5. **Error Prevention**: Include examples that avoid common Cypher pitfalls

### Customizing Examples

You can create different example files for different use cases:
- `query_examples_office.yml` - Office-specific queries
- `query_examples_retail.yml` - Retail-specific queries
- `query_examples_financial.yml` - Financial analysis queries

Then update the `Text2CypherRetrieverBuilder` to use your custom file:

```python
retriever = Text2CypherRetrieverBuilder(
    driver=driver,
    database=database,
    llm=llm,
    examples_file="query_examples_office.yml"
)
```
